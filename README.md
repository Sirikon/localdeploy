## Installation ##

### Automatic ###

```
curl https://molly.sirikon.me/install.sh | bash
```
### Manual ###

```
wget https://dl.sirikon.me/molly.zip
```

This will download a zip file with molly binary inside,
put it wherever you want (`/usr/bin` for example) be sure it's
a path inside your `$PATH` environment variable.

Whatever option you choose, once done, you should be able to run `molly`
command on your terminal.

__Note__: Right now molly doesn't self-install as a service, you need
to do this by yourself to be sure it's always working. This service
should run the command `molly daemon`.

## Usage ##

### Creating a new project ###

Run:

```
molly project add [project name]
```

This will create the folder structures inside `/srv/molly/[project name]`, here you
can find the `run.sh` and `deploy.sh` files, which are used to define how
to run and deploy your project. (both files are executed with
`/srv/molly/[project name]/files` as CWD)

For example, for a Node.js project, the deploy.sh file would look like this:

```
unzip $MOLLY_ARTIFACT
/path/to/npm install
```

And the run.sh file should look like this:

```
EXAMPLE_ENV_VAR=example_value
/path/to/node index.js
```
